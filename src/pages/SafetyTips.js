                    Bikroy does not offer any form of payment scheme or
                    protection. Please report any emails claiming to offer such
                    services. Avoid using online payment services or escrow
                    sites unless you are 100% sure that they are genuine.

                    Bikroy never sends emails requesting your personal details.
                    If you receive an email asking you to provide your personal
                    details to us, do not open any links. Please report the
                    email and delete it.

                    Avoid anyone that asks for extra fees to buy or sell an item
                    or service. Bikroy never requests payments for its basic
                    services, and doesn't allow items that are not located in
                    Sri Lanka, so import and brokerage fees should never be
                    required.
